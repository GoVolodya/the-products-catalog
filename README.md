# The Products catalog

- [DEMO LINK](https://GoVolodya.github.io/the-products-catalog/)

Please have a look at this Products catalog. We are excited to present this project and would love your feedback.

A product catalog site serves as a comprehensive online showcase for a company's products, allowing users to browse
through various categories and view detailed information about each item. Each product is accompanied by engaging
visuals, concise descriptions, and key details, making it easy for customers to explore the available options.
It's an essential tool for businesses looking to present their offerings in a well-organized and user-friendly manner.


## Technologies Used

### 1. HTML
The app page's structure is built using HTML, providing the fundamental markup that defines the layout and content
of the page.

### 2. SCSS
Styling for the landing page is done using SCSS, a CSS preprocessor that allows for more efficient and powerful styling
through features like variables, nesting, and mixins.

### 3. BEM
The BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology is used to organize and name CSS classes in a consistent, modular way,
making the code easier to manage, scale, and maintain.

### 4. React
The Todo application is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library that allows for the creation of dynamic
and interactive user interfaces through component-based architecture.

### 5. JavaScript/JSX
The app leverages JavaScript, combined with JSX syntax, to manage the applicationâ€™s logic, state, and rendering
of components efficiently, making it responsive and user-friendly.

### 6. TypeScript
TypeScript is used to add static typing to the application, which helps catch errors during development and makes
the code more robust and maintainable.

### 7. Redux
Redux is used to manage the global state of the application, providing a predictable state container that helps
ensure consistency across different components and makes the application's state more manageable and easier to debug.
